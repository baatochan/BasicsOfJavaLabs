6 basic java apps done in learning purposes (java course at the university)


Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

This repo contains 6 basic apps that I was supposed to code during labs on my University.
The labs was all about learning basics of Java programming language.

This repo contains 6 'programs' that I coded during them:
1. ConsoleApplication.BasicOnlineStore - app that imitates basic store with console interface
2. BasicGraphicEditor - first window app
3.1. CollectionComparisonApp - app showing differences between basic collection structures using strings as data
3.2. RoomCollectionComparisonApp - same as above but using custom class objects as data
4. ProducerConsumerApp - app representing producer-consumer problem as a basic way to show usage of threads
5. ExamApp - unfinished app done as a refresh of knowledge before exam

Interfaces of all the apps are in Polish.
